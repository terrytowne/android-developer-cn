<p>Before you publish your app on Google Play and distribute it to users, you
need to get the app ready, test it, and prepare your promotional materials. </p>

<p>This document helps you understand the publishing process and get ready for a
successful product launch on Google Play. It summarizes some of the
tasks you'll need to complete before publishing your app on Google Play, such as
creating a signed, release-ready APK, understanding the requirements of the app,
and creating the product page and graphic assets for your app.</p>

<p>The preparation and publishing tasks are numbered to give you a rough idea of
sequence. However, you can handle the tasks in any sequence that works for you
or you can skip steps as appropriate.</p>

<p>As you move toward publishing, a variety of support resources are available to
you. Relevant links are provided in each step.</p>


<h2 id="process">1. Understand the publishing process</h2>

<p>Before you begin the steps in this checklist, you should take a moment to
read and understand the overall publishing workflow and become familiar with how
the process works. In particular, you or your development team will need to
prepare your app for release using a process common to all Android apps.
The <a
href="../../../tools/publishing/publishing_overview.html">Publishing
Workflow</a> documents provide the details on how publishing works and how to
get an APK ready for release. </p>

<p>Once you are familiar with publishing in general, read this document to
understand the issues that you should consider when publishing an app on Google
Play. </p>

<h2 id="core-app-quality">3. Test for Core App Quality</h2>

<p>Before you publish an app on Google Play, it's important to make sure that
it meets the basic quality expectations for all Android apps, on all of the devices that you
are targeting. You can check your app's quality by setting up a test
environment and testing the app against a short set of <strong>core app quality criteria</strong>.
For complete information, see the <a
href="../../../distribute/googleplay/quality/core.html">Core App Quality Guidelines</a>. 
</p>

<p>If your app is targeting tablet devices, make sure that it delivers a rich, compelling
experience to your tablet customers. See the <a

<h2 id="rating">4. Determine your app's content rating</h2>

<p>Google Play requires you to set a content rating for your app, which informs
Google Play users of its maturity level. Before you publish, you should confirm
what rating level you want to use. The available content rating levels are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everyone</li>
<li>Low maturity</li>
<li>Medium maturity</li>
<li>High maturity</li>
</ul>

<p>On their Android devices, Android users can set the desired maturity level
for browsing. Google Play then filters apps based on the setting, so the content
rating you select can affect the app's distribution to users. You can assign (or
change) the content rating for your app in the Developer Console, so no changes
are required in your app binary.</p>

<h2 id="countries">5. Determine country distribution</h2>

<p>Google Play lets you control what countries and territories your app is
distributed to. For widest reach and the largest potential customer base, you
would normally want to distribute to all available countries and territories.
However, because of business needs, app requirements, or launch dependencies,
you might want to exclude one or more countries from your distribution. </p>

<p>It's important to determine the exact country distribution early, because it
can affect:</p>
<ul>
<li>The need for localized resources in the app</li>
<li>The need for a localized app description in the Developer Console</li>
<li>Legal requirements for the app that may be specific to certain
countries</li>
<li>Time zone support, local pricing, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>With your country targeting in mind, you should assess what
your localization needs are, both in your app and in its Google Play listing
details, and start the work of localization well in advance of your
launch target date.</p>

<p>See <a href="../../../distribute/googleplay/publish/localizing.html">Localization
Checklist</a> for key steps and considerations in the localizing process. </p>

<h2 id="size">6. Confirm the app's overall size</h2>

<p>The overall size of your app can affect its design and how you publish it on
Google Play. Currently, the maximum size for an APK published on Google Play is
<strong>50 MB</strong>. If your app exceeds that size, or if you want to offer a
secondary download, you can use <a
href="../../../google/play/expansion-files.html">APK Expansion Files</a>,
which Google Play will host for free on its server infrastructure and
automatically handle the download to devices.</p>

<ul>
<li>The maximum size for an APK published on Google Play is 50 MB.</li>
<li>You can use up to two (2) APK Expansion Files, each up to 2 GB in size, for
each APK.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using APK Expansion files is a convenient, cost-effective method of
distributing large apps. However, the use of APK Expansion Files requires some
changes in your app binary, so you will need to make those changes before
creating your release-ready APK.</p>

<p>To minimize the size of your app binary, make sure that you run the
<a href="../../../tools/help/proguard.html">Proguard</a> tool on your code when
building your release-ready APK.</p>

<h2 id="compatibility">7. Confirm the app's platform and screen compatibility ranges</h2>

<p>Before publishing, it's important to make sure that your app is designed to
run properly on the Android platform versions and device screen sizes that you
want to target. 

<p>From an app-compatibility perspective, Android platform versions are defined
by <a href="../../../guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#ApiLevels">API level</a>. You should
confirm the minimum version that your app is compatible with (<a
href="../../../guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html"><code>&lt;minSdkVersion&gt;</code></a>),
as that will affect its distribution to Android
devices once it is published. </p>

<p>For screen sizes, you should confirm that the app runs properly and looks
good on the range of screen sizes and densities that you want to support. You
should confirm the minimum screen-size and density support that your app
declares (<a
href="../../../guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html"><code>&lt;supports-screens&gt;</code></a>),
since that can affect its distribution to
Android devices once it is published. </p>

<h2 id="free-priced">8. Decide whether your app will be free or priced</h2>

<p>On Google Play, you can publish apps as free to download or priced. Free apps
can be downloaded by any Android user in Google Play.
Paid apps can be downloaded only by users who have registered a form of payment
in Google Play, such as a credit card or Direct Carrier Billing.</p>

<p>Deciding whether you app will be free or paid is important because, on Google
Play, <strong>free apps must remain free</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Once you publish your app as a free app, you cannot ever change it to being
a priced app. However, you can still sell in-app products and
subscriptions through Google Play's In-app Billing service.</li>
<li>If you publish your app as a priced app, you <em>can</em> change
it at any time to being a free app (but cannot then change it back to
priced). You can also sell in-app products and subscriptions. </li>
</ul>

<p> If your app is be priced, or if you'll be selling in-app products,
you need set up a Google Wallet merchant account before you can publish.</p>

service to sell a wide range of content, including downloadable content such as
media files or photos, and virtual content such as game levels or potions.
In-app Billing service lets you sell one-time purchases and subscriptions from
inside your app. This can help you to monetize the app over its installed
lifetime. </p>

<p>If your are looking for more ways to monetize your app and build engagement,
you should consider In-app Billing. The service has become very popular with
both users and developers. To use In-app Billing, you need to make changes to
your app binary, so you will need to complete and test your implementation
before creating your release-ready APK.</p>

<h2 id="pricing">10. Set prices for your products</h2>

<p>If your app is priced or you will sell in-app products, Google Play lets you
set prices for your products in a variety of currencies, for users in markets
around the world. You can set prices individually in different currencies, so
you have the flexibility to adjust your price according to market conditions and
exchange rates. </p>

<p>Before you publish, consider how you will price your products
and what your prices will be in various currencies. Later, you can set prices
in all available currencies through the Developer Console.</p>

<h2 id="localize">11. Start localization</h2>

<p>With your country targeting in mind, it's a good idea to assess your localization
needs and start the work of localizing well in advance of your target
launch date.</p>

<p>There are at least three aspects of localization to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>Localizing the strings, images, and other resources in your app</li>
<li>Localizing your app's store listing details on Google Play</li>
<li>Localizing the app's graphic assets, screenshots, and videos that accompany your store listing.</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="../../../distribute/googleplay/publish/localizing.html">Localization Checklist</a> for key steps and considerations in the localizing process. </p>

<p>To localize your store listing, first create and finalize your app title, description, 
and promotional text. Collect and send all of these for localization. You can optionally
translate the "Recent Changes" text for app updates as well. Later you can add your localized
listing details in the Developer Console, or you can  choose to let Google Play auto-translate
your listing details into the languages you support.</p>

<p>A key part of making your app listing attractive to a global customer base is
creating localized versions of your promotional graphics, screenshots and
videos. For example, your app's feature graphic might include text that should
be translated, for maximum effectiveness. You can create different versions of
your promotional graphics for each language and upload them to the Developer
Console. If you offer a promotional video, you can create localized versions of
it and then add a link to the correct localized video for each language you
support.</p>

<p>When your translations are complete, move them into your app resources as needed and test
that they are loaded properly. Save your app's translated listing details for later,
when you upload assets and configure your product details.</p>

<h2 id="graphics">12. Prepare promotional graphics, screenshots, and videos</h2>

<p>When you publish on Google Play, you can supply a variety of high-quality
graphic assets to showcase your app or brand. After you publish, these appear on
your product details page, in store listings and search results, and elsewhere.
These graphic assets are key parts of a successful product details page that
attracts and engages users, so you should consider having a professional produce
them for you. Screen shots and videos are also very important, because they show
what your app looks like, how it's used or played, and what makes it different.</p>

<p>All of your graphic assets should be designed so that they are easy to see
and highlight your app or brand in a colorful, interesting way. The assets
should reference the same logo and icon as users will actually find in the All
Apps launcher once they have downloaded the app. Your graphic assets should also
fit in well with the graphic assets of other apps published by you, which will
be also be displayed to users on your product details page. </p>

<p>To help you market your app more effectively to a global audience, Google
Play lets you create localized versions of your promotional graphics,
screenshots, and videos and upload them to the Developer Console. When a user
visits your app's store listing, Google Play displays the promotional graphic,
screenshots and video that you've provided for the user's language.</p>

<p>To localize your promotional graphics, you can translate any embedded text, use
different imagery or presentation, or change your marketing approach to best address the needs
of users in specific languages. For example, if your feature or promotional graphic
includes and embedded product name or tag line, you can translate that text
and add it to a localized version of the promotional graphic.</p>

<p>Because your localized graphic assets and videos are so important, you should get
started on creating them and localizing them well in advance of your target
publishing date. </p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Localized promotional graphics and videos
are supported only in the new Developer Console design.</p>

<h2 id="apk">13. Build and upload the release-ready APK</h2>

<p>When you are satisfied that your app meets your UI, compatibility, and
quality requirements, you can build the release-ready version of the app. The
release-ready APK is what you you will upload to the Developer Console and
distribute to users. 

<p>The process for preparing a release-ready APK is the same for all apps,
regardless of how they are distributed. Generally the process includes basic code cleanup
and optimization, building and signing with your release key, and final testing.
When you are finished preparing your application for release, you'll have a signed
APK file that you can upload to the Developer Console for distribution to
users. </p>

<p>For complete details on how to create a release-ready version of your app,
read <a href="../../../tools/publishing/preparing.html">Preparing for
Release</a>.</p>

<p>Before launching your app, it's always valuable to get real-world feedback
from users &mdash; even more so when you are launching a new app. It's highly
recommended that you distribute a pre-release version of your app to users
across your key markets and provide an easy means for them to provide feedback
and report bugs. </p>

<p>Google Play can help you set up a beta program for your app. After you sign
in to the Developer Console and upload your APK, you can set up groups of users
for alpha testing and beta testing the app. You can start with a small group of
alpha testers, then move to a larger group of beta testers. Once users are
added, they access your app's store listing and install the app. User feedback
from alpha and beta testers goes directly to you and is not posted as public
reviews. </p>

<p>The feedback you receive will help you adjust your UI, translations, and
store listing to ensure a great experience for users. </p>

<h2 id="product-page">15. Complete the app's product details</h2>

<p>On Google Play, your app's product information is shown to users on its
product details page, the page that users visit to learn more about your app and
the page from which they will decide to purchase or download your app, on their
Android devices or on the web.</p>

<p>Google Play gives you a variety of ways to promote your app and engage with
users on your product details page, from colorful graphics, screenshots, and
videos to localized descriptions, release details, and links to your other apps.
As you prepare to publish your app, make sure that you take advantage of all
that your product details page can offer, making your app as compelling as
possible to users.</p>

<p>You should begin planning your product page in advance of your target launch
date, arranging for localized description, high-quality graphic assets,
screenshots and video, and so on. </p>

<p>As you get near your target publishing date, you should become familiar with 
all the fields, options, and assets associated with the product details configuration
page in the Developer Console. As you collect the information and assets for the
page, make sure that you can enter or upload it to the Developer Console, until 
the page is complete and ready for publishing. </p>

<p>After you've set your app's geographic targeting in the Developer Console,
remember to add your localized product details, promotional graphics, and so on, for all of the
languages that you support.</p>

<p>If your app is targeting tablet devices, make sure to include at least one screen
shot of the app running on a tablet, and highlight your app's support for tablets
in the app description, release notes, promotional campaigns, and elsewhere.</p>

<h2 id="support">18. Support users after launch</h2>

<p>After you publish an app or an app update, it's crucial for you to support
your customers. Prompt and courteous support can provide a better experience for
users that results in better ratings and more positive reviews for your
products. Users are likely to be more engaged with your app and recommend it if
you are responsive to their needs and feedback.  This is especially true after
publishing if you are using a coordinated promotional campaign.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways that you can keep in touch with users and offer
them support. The most fundamental is to provide your <em>support email
address</em> on your product details page. Beyond that, you can provide support
in any way you choose, such as a forum, mailing list or a Google+ page.  The
Google Play team does provide user support for downloading, installing and
payments issues, but issues that fall outside of these topics will fall under
your domain.  Examples of issues you can support include:  feature requests,
questions about using the app and questions about compatibility settings.  </p>

<p>After publishing, plan to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Check your ratings and reviews frequently on your app's product details
page. Watch for recurring issues that could signal bugs or other issues. </li>
<li>Be mindful of new Android platform version launches, as compatibility
settings for your apps might need to be updated.</li>
<li>Put a link to your support resources on your web site and set up any other
support such as forums.</li>
<li>Provide an appropriate support email address on your product details page
and respond to users when they take the time to email you.</li>
<li>Beyond the automatic refund window offered by Google Play, be generous with
your own refund policy, as satisfied users will be more likely to purchase in
the future. </li>
<li>Acknowledge and fix issues in your app. It helps to be transparent and
list known issues on your product details page proactively.  </li>
<li>Publish updates as frequently as you are able, without sacrificing quality
or annoying users with too-frequent updates. </li>
<li>With each update, make sure to provide a summary of what's changed. You can
enter this information in the Developer Console. Users will read it and
appreciate that you are serious about improving the quality of your app. </li>
